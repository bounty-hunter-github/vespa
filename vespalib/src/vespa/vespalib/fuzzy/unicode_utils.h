 * Encodes a single UTF-32 codepoint `u32_char` to a 1-4 byte UTF-8 sequence and
 * appends it to `out_str.`
 *
 * Note that this will happily encode code points that aren't technically part of
 * the valid UTF-8 range, but which will still be correct in memcmp() byte-wise
 * ordering, which is the API contract we expose.
 *
 * In particular, this includes:
 *   - high/low surrogate ranges U+D800 through U+DFFF (surrogate pairs not allowed
 *     in UTF-8)
 *   - U+10FFFF + 1 (outside max code point range by one)
 *
 * ... So don't copy this function for use as a general UTF-8 emitter, as it is not
 * _technically_ conformant!
